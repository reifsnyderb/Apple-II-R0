# Goal
To have an accurate KiCAD schematic of the Apple II Revision 0 System Board.

# Apple II R0 Notes

This schematic was taken from the [BitPreserve project](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve) and compared to the Apple II Gerbers by Mike Willegal (http://www.willegal.net/appleii/appleii-first_page.htm).
When necessary, The Apple II Circuit Description by Winston D. Gayler was consulted.

# Current Status

1) Some errors have been found and corrected.
2) Additional work needs to be done to clean-up the schematic.
